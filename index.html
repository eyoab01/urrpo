                <p class="msg-p"><span class="dropcap">U</span>rbanization and population growth in our country has increased significantly, which has led to a significant 
                    increase in the demand for urban infrastructure and social services. Cities are expected to collect better revenue and solve the development
                    questions of their residents properly, but their revenue collection system has not been updated up to now, they have a big gap in terms of 
                    identifying their revenue potential, they have not been able to collect what is known properly, even what is being collected lacks transparency 
                    and fairness, they should collect better revenue and pay their own expenses. Not being able to cover income and the fact that they mostly live on 
                    subsidies when they have to support others are the main problems mentioned. This situation has led to the fact that cities have limited financial
                    capacity to provide urban services and infrastructure based on the needs of their residents.<br><br>
                    The government is making great efforts so that cities can get rid of their problems and has a strong source of income and meet the needs of 
                    their
                    residents for infrastructure development and social services. A lot of work is going on.
                    By reforming the city's income, it is important to work not only to make the cities lead an up-to-date 
                    income system and to get out of the subsidy regime, but also to develop a permanent source of income and 
                    have the ability to borrow. It is also important to understand that there are compelling conditions in terms
                     of the current and future urban population and development needs.
                    From this point of view, our office has been given the responsibility and scope of work to improve the revenue system of the cities by establishing a modern, efficient and reliable revenue system based on the participation of the various society and stakeholders of the cities in order to build the capacity of the cities to play their role and to ensure good management, stable and sustainable development that can satisfy the residents. He is working in coordination with those concerned to create an enabling environment.<br><br>
                    In relation to this, the types of revenue currently in use in cities; Earning potential; By conducting a collection and usage survey, from the general principle; Based on the national policies and experience of other countries, capacity building will be the main focus by formulating an improved revenue system for cities and developing legal frameworks to implement the modeled revenue system. By implementing these revenue agendas in sample cities, the experiences gained in this process can be extended to other cities, and institutions are being created to ensure the sustainability of the revenue systems of cities.<br><br>
                    In this process, based on studies and can be a special source of income for our cities, but has not been given attention even at the national level, this sector has been established with its own organization at the institutional level, with the intention of freeing it from the illegal and broker system. In addition to this, in order to systematically manage municipal revenue collection, city management, finance and services have been established at the institutional level.
                    Given that the income collected from the land sector accounts for a large share of the revenue of cities, building the capacity of urban land and planning sector institutions to implement is an important and important issue. The work of making them successful in their careers is being done on a large scale and multi-faceted support works are being done in order to equip the sector with modern technology.<br><br>
                    In order for cities to have universal growth and to enable cities to provide standard infrastructure and services, six sources of income that can generate large incomes for cities have been researched and identified so that they have a legal framework and are being implemented in sample cities. And since the tasks of organizing the land holding archive in a modern way are the primary and important issues, our office is making great efforts to fulfill its role for the success of these tasks.<br><br>
                    Finally, I call on all stakeholders to play their part in the development of the municipal revenue system, as it plays a major role in the need for infrastructure development and good governance in cities.<br><br>
