                    For a long time, the revenue collection system of Ethiopian cities has been ineffective, prone to rent-seeking and ineffective. To support this fact with a concrete example, we can raise property tax revenue. Although the tax has been known in Ethiopia since 1944, it does not generate enough income, is not efficient, is not consistent, is not managed in a name but system, and does not give importance.<br>
                    Since the attitude of rent-seeking is deeply rooted, there is a lot of activity to hide and not pay the income which is public and government wealth. In this regard, the issue that makes the problem more complicated is the fact that in addition to the act of not paying to hide income, the crime of using the bodies and documents in the bureaucracy in an organized and studied way to carry out the act or disguise its legitimacy is on the rise. This lack of thinking is seriously affecting the implementation of the laws issued by states and cities to combat illegal practices in the revenue sector.<br>
                    Therefore, if our cities continue in this way and are abandoned, they will not be able to achieve the goal of becoming a center of transformation and moving from agriculture to industry.
                    The issue of improving the system of property income and other municipal income requires special attention. The tax collection situation of Ethiopian cities is very low compared to other countries or the city's spending needs.<br>
                    Although there are many reasons for this, it is widely observed that the practice of krai collection, which violates the collection systems of municipal revenues and regular revenues, and which accounts for a large share of the city's income, especially in the absence of complete information on the buyer and seller of fixed property transactions in the city, is seen when one party uses it improperly and the other is harmed. . In connection with this, brokerage work that is not guided by the legal system is seen to create a negative impact on the market because it is not guided by the knowledge and system of accurate property valuation information.
                    In general, there is a wide gap between cities in terms of systematically collecting the revenues permitted by law and the revenues that must be collected, and identifying and collecting other high revenue sources with determination and focus, as well as the correctness of the assessment to collect the income from the property fairly, and the desired transparency and orderliness of the property market.<br>
                    From this point of view, the establishment of the school office is based on;<br>
                    Due to the fact that the government has paid attention to the issue of improving the revenue system of cities in order to overcome the internal and external problems mentioned above;
                    <ul>
                        <li> In addition to this, as mentioned above, it lays the foundation and supports the efforts started on the establishment of land and land-related registration and information cadastre for the determination and implementation of property tax;</li>
                        <li>The importance of working together for the successful implementation of urban development finance reform is highlighted.<br>Accordingly, the Urban Revenue Reform Project Office was established at the beginning of 2009 under the Office of the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing (and now the Ministry of Urban and Infrastructure). units and organized into one supporting unit. These units are: </li>

                        <li> System development and technology supply unit</li>
                        <li>The office is organized as having its own administrative and financial unit and it is considered to have a technical committee that monitors and supports important works. </li>
